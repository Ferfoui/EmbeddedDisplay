# EmbeddedDisplay

This is a little project to display things through a small OLED display connected to an
[ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 v1.1](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32s3/esp32-s3-devkitc-1/user_guide.html#esp32-s3-devkitc-1-v1-1) board.
The display is a 128x32 pixel monochrome OLED screen,
and the project uses the [ssd1306 library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306) to control it.

The project is built using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
and the [Arduino framework](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/frameworks/arduino.html).
Moreover, it has been built for a Chinese class presentation (about chinese electronics)
and it is a work in progress.
